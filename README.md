# Discord-Bot
A Discord C#/.NET Bot 

This Discord bot is a chat and voice coded in C#. This bot currently is still in development, further changes to come.

This bot is built to be run on any .NET Framework compatible machine. It is meant for single server usage due to the heavy amount of resources the voice part consumes.

## To Install:

To install do the following:
* Clone our repo
* Create a file called BotToken.txt in the /src directory with your bot token to get connected.
  * The file should contain only the token, nothing else.
* Compile with Visual Studio, and it should be ready to go!
